hledger (http://hledger.org) is a robust, cross-platform, plain text
accounting tool, with command-line, terminal and web UIs. It is an
actively maintained, largely compatible reimplementation of Ledger CLI
with many improvements. You can use it to track money, time,
investments, cryptocurrencies, inventory and more.
