#!/usr/bin/env expect

# Run uitest.empty-ui in the background without needing an interactive
# shell, passing through any arguments. It's pretty stupid to be using
# both expect AND empty, but so far this is the only way I've got it
# to work. The empty script is reasonably reliable at producing the
# output, but can't itself run in a non-interactive script; expect is
# able to make it do that.


# TODO: kill (our) empty process if this script is interrupted
trap {puts {open "|ls"}} {INT TERM}

spawn ./uitest.empty $argv
