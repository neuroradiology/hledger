balancesheet, bs
This command displays a balance sheet, showing historical ending
balances of asset and liability accounts. (To see equity as well, use
the balancesheetequity command.) Amounts are shown with normal positive
sign, as in conventional financial statements.

_FLAGS

The asset and liability accounts shown are those accounts declared with
the Asset or Cash or Liability type, or otherwise all accounts under a
top-level asset or liability account (case insensitive, plurals
allowed).

Example:

$ hledger balancesheet

This command is a higher-level variant of the balance command, and
supports many of that command's features, such as multi-period reports.
It is similar to hledger balance -H assets liabilities, but with smarter
account detection, and liabilities displayed with their sign flipped.

This command also supports the output destination and output format
options The output formats supported are txt, csv, html, and
(experimental) json.
