help
Show the hledger user manual in one of several formats, optionally
positioned at a given TOPIC (if possible). TOPIC is any heading, or
heading prefix, in the manual. Some examples: commands, print, 'auto
postings', periodic.

_FLAGS

This command shows the user manual built in to this hledger version. It
can be useful if the correct version of the hledger manual, or the usual
viewing tools, are not installed on your system.

By default it uses the best viewer it can find in $PATH, in this order:
info, man, $PAGER (unless a topic is specified), less, or stdout. When
run non-interactively, it always uses stdout. Or you can select a
particular viewer with the -i (info), -m (man), or -p (pager) flags.
